# parallel-radix-sort
Parallelization of the Radix Sort algorithm using the programming language C.
This code was developed as a project assignment for the undergraduate Software & Programming of High Perfomance Systems course of [CEID](wwww.ceid.upatras.gr) by Filopoimin Lykokanellos. The implementation is based on the enclosed algorithms in <i>Dani Jiménez-González, Josep-L. Larriba-Pey, Juan J. Navarro.“Case Study: Memory Conscious Parallel Sorting”, Chapter 16, Algorithms for Memory Hierarchies: Advanced Lectures, pp 355-377, vol 2625, 2003</i>.

Besides the sequential algorithm, three parallel implementations were developed.
